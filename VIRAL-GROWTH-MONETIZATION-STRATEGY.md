2. **Middle 10 seconds = Proof**
   - Show actual gameplay
   - Show near-miss moments (almost lost)
   - Show satisfaction (clearing big combos)
   
3. **Last 2 seconds = CTA**
   - "Download now" + app icon
   - Or just game logo (subtle)

## Monetization Strategy: Maximizing Revenue {#monetization-strategy}

### The 50/50 Model (Like Survivor.io)

**Goal:** 50% revenue from ads, 50% from IAP

**Why This Works:**
- Diversified income (not dependent on one source)
- Ads monetize ALL users (even non-payers)
- IAP monetizes whales (big spenders)
- Better LTV (lifetime value) per user

---

### Ad Revenue Strategy

#### Current Setup (What You Have):
1. ✅ **Banner Ads** - Game screen
2. ✅ **Interstitial Ads** - Every 3 games
3. ✅ **Rewarded Ads** - Continue after game over

#### Revenue Potential (Current):
- 1,000 DAU: ~$400/month
- 10,000 DAU: ~$4,000/month
- 100,000 DAU: ~$40,000/month

---

### Enhanced Ad Strategy (Add 4 More Placements)

#### **NEW AD PLACEMENT #1: Daily Bonus Chest** 🎁
**Implementation:**
```
Screen: Home screen
Timing: Once per day (resets at midnight)
User Flow:
1. Player sees chest with countdown timer
2. "Open Free Chest" button (no ad)
3. Gets 100 coins
4. "Watch Ad for 3x Bonus" button appears
5. If watches ad → Gets 300 coins instead
```

**Why It Works:**
- **No loss** - Free chest is always available
- **High value** - 3x multiplier is significant
- **Daily habit** - Encourages daily opens
- **High engagement** - 60-70% watch rate

**Expected Revenue Impact:**
- 60% of users watch ad daily
- 1,000 DAU × 0.6 = 600 ad views/day
- At $15 CPM = $9/day = $270/month
- **+67% ad revenue increase**

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
// Add to home screen
interface DailyChest {
  lastOpened: Date;
  canOpen: boolean;
  baseReward: 100;
  adMultiplier: 3;
}

function showDailyChest() {
  if (canOpenChest()) {
    // Show chest button
    // On open: give 100 coins
    // Show "3x bonus" button
    // On ad watch: give 300 coins total
  }
}
```

---

#### **NEW AD PLACEMENT #2: Double Score Reward** 🏆
**Implementation:**
```
Screen: Game over screen
Timing: After every game (above "Play Again")
User Flow:
1. Game ends, shows score: "You scored 1,234"
2. "Watch Ad to Double Your Score" button
3. If watches ad → Score becomes 2,468
4. Applies to leaderboard and stats
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Immediate gratification** - Just finished game, feeling good
- **Clear value** - Double score = better ranking
- **Optional** - Can skip and play again
- **High engagement** - 45-55% watch rate

**Expected Revenue Impact:**
- 50% of games end with ad watch
- 1,000 DAU × 5 games/day × 0.5 = 2,500 ads/day
- At $15 CPM = $37.50/day = $1,125/month
- **+281% ad revenue increase**

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
// Add to game over screen
interface GameOverState {
  score: number;
  doubleScoreAvailable: boolean;
  adWatched: boolean;
}

function showDoubleScoreOffer() {
  if (!adWatched) {
    // Show "Double Score" button
    // On ad watch: multiply score × 2
    // Update leaderboard
  }
}
```

---

#### **NEW AD PLACEMENT #3: Power-Up Booster** ⚡
**Implementation:**
```
Screen: Mid-game (when board is 70% full)
Timing: Once per game, at critical moment
User Flow:
1. Board is getting full, player struggling
2. "Need Help?" prompt appears
3. "Watch Ad for Power-Up" button
4. If watches ad → Gets random power-up immediately
5. Can use right away to clear blocks
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Perfect timing** - Player needs help NOW
- **High value** - Could save the game
- **Emotional** - Desperate moment, willing to watch
- **Moderate engagement** - 30-40% watch rate

**Expected Revenue Impact:**
- 35% of games trigger ad
- 1,000 DAU × 5 games/day × 0.35 = 1,750 ads/day
- At $15 CPM = $26.25/day = $787.50/month
- **+197% ad revenue increase**

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
// Add to game logic
interface PowerUpBooster {
  triggered: boolean;
  boardFullness: number;
  threshold: 0.7; // 70% full
}

function checkPowerUpBooster() {
  if (boardFullness >= 0.7 && !triggered) {
    // Pause game
    // Show "Need Help?" modal
    // On ad watch: give random power-up
    // Resume game
  }
}
```

---

#### **NEW AD PLACEMENT #4: Unlock Premium Piece** 🎨
**Implementation:**
```
Screen: After game over (alternate with continue)
Timing: Every 5th game over
User Flow:
1. Game ends
2. "You unlocked a special piece!"
3. Shows preview of rare/cool piece design
4. "Watch Ad to Unlock" button
5. If watches ad → Permanently unlocks piece
6. Can use in future games (cosmetic only)
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Collectible** - People love unlocking things
- **FOMO** - Fear of missing out on rare pieces
- **Cosmetic** - Not pay-to-win, just cool
- **Moderate engagement** - 25-35% watch rate

**Expected Revenue Impact:**
- 30% watch rate
- 1,000 DAU × 1 offer per 5 games × 0.3 = 300 ads/day
- At $15 CPM = $4.50/day = $135/month
- **+34% ad revenue increase**

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
// Add to game over screen
interface UnlockablePiece {
  id: string;
  rarity: 'common' | 'rare' | 'epic' | 'legendary';
  unlocked: boolean;
  gamesUntilOffer: number;
}

function offerPieceUnlock() {
  if (gamesPlayed % 5 === 0) {
    // Show piece preview
    // "Watch Ad to Unlock" button
    // On ad watch: mark as unlocked
    // Add to collection
  }
}
```

### IAP Strategy (In-App Purchases)

#### Current Options:
1. ✅ Gem packs (small, medium, large)
2. ✅ Remove ads forever
3. ✅ Premium subscription

#### Enhanced IAP Strategy:

**1. Optimize Pricing (Psychological)**
```
Current → Optimized:
- Small Gems: $0.99 → $0.99 (keep)
- Medium Gems: $4.99 → $3.99 (impulse price)
- Large Gems: $9.99 → $7.99 (better value perception)
- Remove Ads: $2.99 → $4.99 (more revenue per sale)
- Premium: $4.99/mo → $6.99/mo (more sustainable)
```

**2. Add Starter Pack (Best Seller)**
```
Starter Pack: $1.99 (ONE TIME ONLY)
Contents:
- 500 gems
- Remove ads for 7 days
- 3x power-ups
- Exclusive piece skin

Why it works:
- Low barrier to entry ($1.99 is impulse buy)
- One-time only creates urgency
- Gets users to convert from free to paying
- 10-15% of users will buy (very high)
```

**3. Add VIP Pass (Weekly)**
```
VIP Pass: $2.99/week
Benefits:
- 2x coins from games
- Daily 200 gems
- No interstitial ads
- Exclusive VIP skins
- Priority support

Why it works:
- Cheaper than monthly subscription
- Weekly commitment easier than monthly
- High perceived value
- 5-8% conversion rate
```

**4. Limited Time Offers**
```
Appears after major milestones:
- Reach level 50: "50% off gems!"
- Lose 5 games in a row: "Need help? Gems 30% off!"
- 7 days since install: "Welcome back! Special offer!"

Why it works:
- Creates urgency (24-hour timer)
- Targets specific user states
- Higher conversion (2-3x normal)
```

**Expected IAP Revenue:**
- 1,000 DAU: ~$1,000-2,000/month
- 10,000 DAU: ~$10,000-20,000/month  
- 100,000 DAU: ~$100,000-200,000/month

}
```

**Priority System** (if multiple ads ready):
1. Rewarded ads (user-initiated) - ALWAYS show
2. Daily chest - Show once per day
3. Double score - Show if game just ended
4. Power-up booster - Show if board critical
5. Interstitial - Show only if frequency rules met

## Case Study: What NOT to Do

### Common Mistakes (Learn from others' failures)

**1. Too Many Forced Ads**
- Showing interstitial every game = uninstall
- Users tolerate 1 forced ad per 5-10 minutes max
- Survivor.io has ZERO forced ads (all rewarded)

**2. Poor Ad Timing**
- Mid-game interstitials = rage quit
- Ads during loading = frustration
- Only show ads at natural breaks

**3. Ignoring Reviews**
- Negative reviews compound
- Respond to every review (especially negative)
- Fix issues fast

**4. Spending Too Much Too Soon**
- Don't spend $10K on ads in Month 1
- Test small, learn, then scale
- Most indie devs go broke from over-spending on ads

**5. No Metrics Tracking**
- Flying blind = wasted money
- Set up analytics BEFORE launching ads
- Make data-driven decisions

**6. Expecting Instant Success**
- Takes 6-12 months to see real traction
- Keep iterating, don't give up
- Most successful apps took years to blow up
